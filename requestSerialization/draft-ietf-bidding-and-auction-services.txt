1.  Introduction

   Today, real-time bidding and ad auctions are executed on servers that
   may not provide technical guarantees of security.  Some users have
   concerns about how their data is handled to generate relevant ads and
   in how that data is shared.  Protected Audience API (Android
   (https://developer.android.com/design-for-safety/privacy-sandbox/
   fledge), Chrome (https://developer.chrome.com/docs/privacy-sandbox/
   fledge/)) provides ways to preserve privacy and limit third-party
   data sharing by serving personalized ads based on previous mobile app
   or web engagement.

   For all platforms, Protected Audience may require real-time services
   (https://github.com/privacysandbox/fledge-docs/blob/main/
   trusted_services_overview.md).  In the initial proposal by Chrome
   (https://github.com/WICG/turtledove/blob/main/FLEDGE.md), bidding and
   auction for Protected Audience ad demand is executed locally.  This
   can demand computation requirements that may be impractical to
   execute on devices with limited processing power, or may be too slow
   to render ads due to network latency.

   This Bidding and Auction Services proposal outlines a way to allow
   Protected Audience computation to take place on cloud servers, rather
   than running locally on a user's device.  Moving computations to the
   cloud has the following benefits:

   *  Scalable auctions.

   *  A scalable ad auction may include several buyers and sellers and
      that can demand more compute resources and network bandwidth.

   *  System health of the user's device.

   *  Ensure better system health of the user's device by freeing up
      computational cycles and network bandwidth.

   *  Better latency of ad auctions.

   *  Server to server communication on the cloud is faster than
      multiple device to server calls.

   *  Adtech code can execute faster on servers with higher computing
      power compared to a device.

   *  Servers have better processing power.

   *  Adtechs can run more compute intensive workloads on a server
      compared to a device for better utility.

   Standardized protocols for interacting with Bidding and Auction
   Services are essential to creating a diverse and healthy ecosystem
   for such services.

1.1.  Scope

   This document provides a specification for the request and response
   message format that a client can use to communicate with remote
   services that allows the client to offload much of the work involved
   in running an advertisement selection auction as part of the client's
   implementation of the Protected Audience API.

   This document does not describe distribution of private keys to the
   bidding and auction services.

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Message Format Specifications

2.1.  Overview

   To understand this document, it is important to know that the
   communication between the client and the remote servers uses a
   request-response message exchange pattern.  The request will first
   reach a seller server, after which the seller will forward parts of
   the request to buyer servers.  It is then up to the seller server to
   gather buyer responses and form a final response for the client.
   More detail about the seller and buyer servers can be found in the
   server-side system design documentation
   (https://github.com/privacysandbox/protected-auction-services-
   docs/blob/main/bidding_auction_services_system_design.md).

2.1.2.  Message Framing and Padding

   Bidding and Auction Services requests and responses have the
   following framing:

   +==========+=========+=============+========+=============+=========+
   | Byte     | 0       | 0           | 1 to 4 | 5 to        | Size+5  |

                                  Table 2

   where the the first 3 bits of the frame header specify the payload
   version and the following 5 bits specify the compression algorithm.
   The format described in this document corresponds to version 0.

   The compression method's value in bits 4-0 in Section 2.2.2
   corresponds to the below table:

                    +-------------+------------------+

                                 Table 3

   The amount of padding depends on the type of message and will be
   discussed for each message type separately.

2.2.  Request Format

   This section discusses the request message sent from the client to
   the Bidding and Auction Services endpoint.

   The request from the Client to Bidding and Auction Services consists
   of an [HPKE] encrypted payload with attached header (see
   Section 2.2.1).  The plaintext payload contains a framing header,
   outer request, and padding (see Section 2.2.2).  The request message
   Section 2.2.3 is a [CBOR] encoded message that contains one or more
   compressed interest group lists Section 2.2.3.1.

2.2.1.  Encryption

   The request is encrypted with [HPKE].  The request uses a similar
   encapsulated message format to that used by [OHTTP], with only an
   additional version field.

   Encapsulated Request {
     Version (8),
     Key Identifier (8),
     HPKE KEM ID (16),
     HPKE KDF ID (16),
     HPKE AEAD ID (16),
     Encapsulated KEM Shared Secret (8 * Nenc),
     HPKE-Protected Request (..),
   }

   The Version for this message SHOULD be 0.  The HPKE KEM ID, HPKE KDF
   ID, and HPKE AEAD ID are the key encapsulation mechanism, key
   derivation function and authenticated encryption with associated data
   function parameters for [HPKE].  For this protocol, a compliant
   implementation MUST support HKDF-SHA256 (0x0010) for HPKE KEM ID,
   HKDF-SHA256 (0x0001) for HPKE KDF ID, and AES-256-GCM (0x0002) for
   HPKE AEAD ID.

   Encryption of the request is similar to in [OHTTP] Section 4.3
   (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9458#name-encapsulation-of-
   requests), only with a different media type and the Version prepended
   to the encrypted message:

   1.  Construct a message header (hdr) by concatenating the values of
       the Key Identifier, HPKE KEM ID, HPKE KDF ID, and HPKE AEAD ID in
       network byte order.

   2.  Build a sequence of bytes (info) by concatenating the ASCII-
       encoded string "message/auction request", a zero byte, and hdr.

   3.  Create a sending HPKE context by invoking SetupBaseS()
       (Section 5.1.1 (https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9180#section-5.1.1)
       of [HPKE]) with the public key of the receiver pkR and info.
       This yields the context sctxt and an encapsulation key enc.

   4.  Encrypt request by invoking the Seal() method on sctxt
       (Section 5.2 (https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9180#section-5.2) of
       [HPKE]) with empty associated data aad, yielding ciphertext ct.

   5.  Concatenate the values of Version, hdr, enc, and ct.

   In pseudocode, this procedure is as follows:

   hdr = concat(encode(1, key_id),
                encode(2, kem_id),
                encode(2, kdf_id),
                encode(2, aead_id))
   info = concat(encode_str("message/bhttp request"),
                 encode(1, 0),
                 hdr)
   enc, sctxt = SetupBaseS(pkR, info)
   ct = sctxt.Seal("", request)
   enc_request = concat(encode(1,version), hdr, enc, ct)

2.2.2.  Framing and Padding

   The plaintext message uses the framing described in Section 2.1.2.

   Messages MAY be zero padded so that the encrypted request is one of
   the following bin sizes: 0KiB, 5KiB, 10KiB, 20KiB, 30KiB, 40KiB,
   55KiB.  An implementation MAY need to remove some data from the
   payload to fit inside the largest bucket.

   A compatible implementation processing requests SHOULD NOT rely on a
   specific padding scheme for requests.

2.2.3.  Request Message

   The request message is a [CBOR] encoded message with the following
   [CDDL] schema:

   request = {
     // TODO description of all fields
     version: int,
     generationId: uuid,
     publisher: origin,
     interestGroups: {
       ; Map of interest group owner to CBOR encoded list of interest
       ; groups compressed using the method described in § Compression.
       * interestGroupOwner => bstr
     },
     ? enableDebugReporting: bool
   }

   The version field SHOULD be set to 0 for this version of the
   protocol.  The interestGroups field is a map from interest group
   owner to a compressed, [CBOR]-encoded list of interest groups for
   that owner.

2.2.3.1.  List of Interest Groups

   A list of interest group is encoded in [CBOR] with the following
   [CDDL] schema:

   interestGroups = [ * interestGroup ]
   interestGroup = {
     ; This interest group's name, see
     ; https://wicg.github.io/turtledove/#interest-group-name.
     name: tstr,

     ; Keys used to look up real-time bidding signals, see
     ; https://wicg.github.io/turtledove/#interest-group-trusted-bidding-signals-keys.
     ? biddingSignalsKeys: [* tstr],
     ; Data about the user that the bidder can use during bid calculation, see
     ; https://wicg.github.io/turtledove/#interest-group-user-bidding-signals.
     ? userBiddingSignals: json,
     ; Contains various ads that the interest group might show. See
     ; https://wicg.github.io/turtledove/#interest-group-ads.
     ? ads: [* adRenderId],

     ; Contains various ad components (or "products") that can be used to
     ; construct ads composed of multiple pieces — a top-level ad template
     ; "container" which includes some slots that can be filled in with
     ; specific "products". See
     ; https://wicg.github.io/turtledove/#interest-group-ad-components.
     ? components: [* adRenderId],
     ? browserSignals: {
       ; Number of times the group was joined in the last 30 days.
       ? joinCount: int,

       ; Number of times the group bid in an auction in the last 30
       ; days.
       ? bidCount: int,

       ; Tuple of time-ad pairs for a previous win for this interest
       ; group that occurred in the last 30 days.
       ; The time is specified in seconds before the containing
       ; auctionBlob was requested.
       ? prevWins: [* [int, adRenderId]],

       ; The most recent join time for this group expressed
       ; in milli seconds before the containing auctionBlob
       ; was requested. This field will be used by newer client
       ; versions. For older devices, the precison will be in seconds.
       ; If recencyMs is present, this value will be used to offer
       ; higher precision. If not, recency will be used. Only
       ; one of the recency or recencyMs is expected to present in
       ; the request.
       ? recencyMs: int
     }
   }

   Each list is separately compressed with the compression method
   indicated in the Section 2.1.2 header.

2.2.4.  Generating a Request

   This section describes how the client MAY form and serialize request
   messages in order to communicate with the Bidding and Auction
   services.

   This algorithm takes as input all of the relevant interest groups, an
   optional desired total size, an optional list of interest group
   owners to include each with an optional desired size, and the [HPKE]
   public key and its associated key ID.  It generates a message using
   [GZIP] for compression.

   1.   Let included_groups be an empty map.

   2.   If desired total size is not specified, but the list of interest
        group owners includes at least one entry with a specified
        desired size:

        1.  Set desired total size to the sum of all specified desired
            size in the list of interest group owners.

   3.   Group the list of relevant interest groups by owner into a map
        of from interest group owner to a list of interest groups sorted
        by decreasing priority, interest group map.

   4.   If the list of interest group owners is specified, remove
        interest groups whose owner is not on the list.

   5.   Construct a request, request, as normal only with the value of
        the interestGroups field for each interest group owner as zero
        length.

   6.   Set current_size to be the serialized size of the encrypted
        request created from request without padding.

   7.   Set remaining_allocated_size to 0.

   8.   Set remaining_unsized_owners to 0.

   9.   For each interest group owner, interest group list in interest
        group map:

        1.  If there is a desired size for interest group owner:

            1.  Increment remaining_allocated_size by desired size.

        2.  Otherwise

            1.  Increment remaining_unsized_owners by 1.

   10.  For each interest group owner, interest group list in interest
        group map where there is a desired size specified for interest
        group owner:

        1.  If the number of unsized_owners is not 0:

            1.  Set the allowed_interest_group_size to the desired size
                for this interest group owner.  This is a fixed size
                allocation.

        2.  Otherwise:

            1.  Let remaining_size be equal to the desired total size-
                current_size.

            2.  Set the allowed_interest_group_size to
                remaining_size*desired_size/remaining_allocated_size.
                This is a proportional allocation.

        3.  Set remaining_allocated_size = remaining_allocated_size-
            current_size.

        4.  [CBOR] encode the interest group list into serialized list.

        5.  [GZIP] the serialized list into compressed list.

        6.  If adding the compressed list to request would make it more
            than allowed_interest_group_size larger than the current
            size, then remove the lowest priority interest group and
            repeat from the previous step.

        7.  Set request["interestGroups"][interest group owner] to
            compressed list.

        8.  Set included_groups[interest group owner] to interest group
            list.

        9.  Set current_size to be the serialized size of the encrypted
            request created from request without padding.

   11.  For each interest group owner, interest group list in interest
        group map where there is not desired size specified for interest
        group owner:

        1.  Let remaining_size be equal to the desired total size-
            current_size.

        2.  Set the allowed_interest_group_size to
            remaining_size*/remaining_unsized_owners.  This is a equal
            size allocation.

        3.  Decrement remaining_unsized_owners by 1.

        4.  [CBOR] encode the interest group list into serialized list.

        5.  [GZIP] the serialized list into compressed list.

        6.  If adding the compressed list to request would make it more
            than allowed_interest_group_size larger than the current
            size, then remove the lowest priority interest group and
            repeat from the previous step.

        7.  Set request["interestGroups"][interest group owner] to
            compressed list.

        8.  Set included_groups[interest group owner] to interest group
            list.

        9.  Set current_size to be the serialized size of the encrypted
            request created from request without padding.

   12.  If there are no interest groups in the request, discard the
        request and return failure.

   13.  Prepend the framing header to request with Compression set to 2.

   14.  If desired total size is set then zero pad request to desired
        total size.  Otherwise zero pad `request up to the smallest bin
        size in Section 2.2.2 larger than request.

   15.  Encrypt request using the public key and its key id as in
        Section 2.2.1 to get the encrypted message and hpke context.

   16.  Let the request context be the tuple (included_groups, hpke
        context)

   17.  Return the request and the request context.

2.3.  Response Format

2.3.1.  Bidding and Auction Services to Client

   This section describes how the client MUST deserialize response
   messages from the Bidding and Auction Services.  The steps MUST be
   performed in the following order: decryption (Section 2.3.2),
   decompression (Section 2.3.3), and finally parsing the response
   payload as in Section 2.3.4.

   The required inputs from the client to the steps in {#services-to-
   client}:

   1.  The encrypted response byte string.

   2.  The request context created while generating the request in
       Section 2.2.4.

   The resulting output for the client is:

   1.  The decoded response data structure, as described in
       Section 2.3.4.

2.3.2.  Decryption

   The response message is encrypted using HPKE with the encapsulation
   performed according to Section 4.4 (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/
   rfc9458.html#name-encapsulation-of-responses) of [OHTTP] as the
   response to the request message.

   The client MUST decrypt the response by following the standard
   [OHTTP] Encapsulated Response decryption procedure (https://www.rfc-
   editor.org/rfc/rfc9458#section-4.4-5).  The context used for
   decryption MUST be precisely the same context blob that was created
   when generating the request Section 2.2.4.

2.3.3.  Decompression

   The message framing is exactly as in Section 2.2.2, but the entire
   response payload is compressed.  Starting with Byte 0, read bits 4-0
   and use the chart in Section 2.1.2 to decode which decompression
   algorithm MUST be applied to the response payload.

   The output of the decompression process will be a payload equivalent
   to the auction server response struct (https://wicg.github.io/
   turtledove/#server-auction-response), as further described in
   Section 2.3.4.

2.3.4.  Response Payload Data

   After decompression, the result will be a [CBOR] byte string
   (described below).

   The byte string MUST be decoded into a format usable by the client,
   the server auction response structure (https://wicg.github.io/
   turtledove/#server-auction-response).  The server auction response
   structure is the final, consumable output of Section 2.3.1.

   To perform this decoding, use a compliant [CBOR] decoder.  The
   following [CDDL] describes the structure of the CBOR data.  Map the
   decoded data to the server auction response structure according to
   the instructions provided for each field.
