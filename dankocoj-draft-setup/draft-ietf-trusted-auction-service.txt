1.  Introduction

   Today, real-time bidding and ad auctions are executed on servers that
   may not provide technical guarantees of security.  Some users have
   concerns about how their data is handled to generate relevant ads and
   in how that data is shared.  Protected Audience API (Android
   (https://developer.android.com/design-for-safety/privacy-sandbox/
   fledge), Chrome (https://developer.chrome.com/docs/privacy-sandbox/
   fledge/)) provides ways to preserve privacy and limit third-party
   data sharing by serving personalized ads based on previous mobile app
   or web engagement.

   For all platforms, Protected Audience may require real-time services
   (https://github.com/privacysandbox/fledge-docs/blob/main/
   trusted_services_overview.md).  In the initial proposal by Chrome
   (https://github.com/WICG/turtledove/blob/main/FLEDGE.md), bidding and
   auction for Protected Audience ad demand is executed locally.  This
   can demand computation requirements that may be impractical to
   execute on devices with limited processing power, or may be too slow
   to render ads due to network latency.

   This Trusted Auction Service proposal outlines a way to allow
   Protected Audience computation to take place on cloud servers in a
   trusted execution environment, rather than running locally on a
   user's device.  Moving computations to cloud in a Trusted Execution
   Environment (TEE) (https://github.com/privacysandbox/fledge-
   docs/blob/main/trusted_services_overview.md#trusted-execution-
   environment) have the following benefits:

   *  Scalable auctions.

   *  A scalable ad auction may include several buyers and sellers and
      that can demand more compute resources and network bandwidth.

   *  System health of the user's device.

   *  Ensure better system health of the user's device by freeing up
      computational cycles and network bandwidth.

   *  Better latency of ad auctions.

   *  Server to server communication on the cloud is faster than
      multiple device to server calls.

   *  Adtech code can execute faster on servers with higher computing
      power compared to a device.

   *  Servers have better processing power.

   *  Adtechs can run more compute intensive workloads on a server
      compared to a device for better utility.

   *  trusted execution environment (https://github.com/privacysandbox/
      fledge-docs/blob/main/trusted_services_overview.md#trusted-
      execution-environment) can protect confidentiality of adtech code
      and signals.

   Standardized protocols for interacting with Bidding and Auction
   Services are essential to creating a diverse and healthy ecosystem
   for such services.

1.1.  Scope

   This document provides a specification for the request-response
   message architecture that is required to implement the Protected
   Audience API for executing a remote, TEE-based ad auction.

   This document does not describe distribution of private keys to
   trusted auction services.

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Message Format Specifications

2.1.  Overview

   To understand this document, it is important to know that the
   communication between the browser and the remote servers uses a
   request-response message exchange pattern.  The request will first
   reach a seller server, after which the seller will forward parts of
   the request to buyer servers.  It is then up to the seller server to
   gather buyer responses and form a final response for the browser.
   More detail about the seller and buyer servers can be found in the
   server-side system design documentation
   (https://github.com/privacysandbox/protected-auction-services-
   docs/blob/main/bidding_auction_services_system_design.md).

2.1.1.  Common Definitions

   Section 2 makes frequent use of the following definitions, here
   represented as [CDDL].

   ; As defined in [ORIGIN].
   origin = tstr .regexp "https://([^/:](:[0-9]+)?/"

   ; TODO
   uuid = tstr .regexp "[a-fA-F0-9]{8}-[a-fA-F0-9]{4}-[a-fA-F0-9]{4}-[a-fA-F0-9]{4}-[a-fA-F0-9]{12}"

   ; TODO
   ; Three uppercase letters, ISO 4217 alpha code suggested.
   currency = tstr .size 3 .regexp /^[A-Z]{3}$/

   ; TODO
   json = tstr ; JSON encoded data

   ; As defined in [URL].
   adRenderUrl = tstr;

2.2.  Browser to Trusted Auction Server

   This section describes how the browser MUST form request messages in
   order to communicate with the Trusted Auction Server.

2.2.1.  Request Payload Data

   A request payload primarily consists of interest groups.  An interest
   group is represented by the following [CDDL]:

   interestGroups = [ * interestGroup ]
   interestGroup = {
     name: tstr,
     ? biddingSignalsKeys: [* tstr],
     ? userBiddingSignals: json,
     ? ads: [* adRenderId],
     ? components: [* adRenderId],
     ? browserSignals: {
       ; Number of times the group was joined in the last 30 days.
       ? joinCount: int,

       ; Number of times the group bid in an auction in the last 30
       ; days.
       ? bidCount: int,

       ; Tuple of time-ad pairs for a previous win for this interest
       ; group that occurred in the last 30 days.
       ; The time is specified in seconds before the containing
       ; auctionBlob was requested.
       ? prevWins: [* [int, adRenderId]],

       ; The most recent join time for this group expressed
       ; in milli seconds before the containing auctionBlob
       ; was requested. This field will be used by newer client
       ; versions. For older devices, the precison will be in seconds.
       ; If recencyMs is present, this value will be used to offer
       ; higher precision. If not, recency will be used. Only
       ; one of the recency or recencyMs is expected to present in
       ; the request.
       ? recencyMs: int
     }
   }

   adRenderId = tstr

   Each interest group MUST first be represented as [CBOR], and then
   MUST be indiviudally compressed according to the compression
   algorithm specified in the message framing (Section 2.2.3).  This
   compressed interest group data MUST then be aggregated into a map in
   the complete request, which MUST be [CBOR] represented by the
   following [CDDL]:

   request = {
     version: int,
     generationId: uuid,
     publisher: origin,
     interestGroups: {
       * origin => bstr
       ; CBOR encoded list of interest groups compressed
       ; using the method described in `compression`.
     },
     ? enableDebugReporting: bool
   }

   The complete request MUST also be compressed using the same
   compression algorithm as specified in the message framing
   (Section 2.2.3).

2.2.2.  Compression

   The payload MAY undergo compression.

   The compression method's value in bits 4-0 in Section 2.2.3
   corresponds to the below table:

                    +=============+==================+
                    | Compression | Description      |
                    +=============+==================+
                    |      0      | No Compression   |
                    +-------------+------------------+
                    |      1      | Brotli [RFC7932] |
                    +-------------+------------------+
                    |      2      | GZIP [RFC1952]   |
                    +-------------+------------------+
                    |     3-31    | Reserved         |
                    +-------------+------------------+

                                 Table 1

2.2.3.  Framing and Padding

   The plaintext message has the following framing:

   +==========+=========+=============+========+=============+=========+
   | Byte     | 0       | 0           | 1 to 4 | 5 to        | Size+5  |
   |          |         |             |        | Size+4      | to end  |
   +==========+=========+=============+========+=============+=========+
   | Bits     | 7-5     | 4-0         | *      | *           | *       |
   +----------+---------+-------------+--------+-------------+---------+
   | Contents | Version | Compression | Size   | Request     | Padding |
   |          |         |             |        | Payload     |         |
   +----------+---------+-------------+--------+-------------+---------+

                                  Table 2

   where the the first 3 bits of the frame header specify the payload
   version and the following 5 bits specify the compression algorithm.
   The format described in this document corresponds to version 0.

   Messages SHOULD be zero padded up to one of the following bin sizes:
   0KiB, 5KiB, 10KiB, 20KiB, 30KiB, 40KiB, 55KiB.  Messages SHALL NOT be
   be larger than 55KiB.  An implementation may need to remove some data
   from the payload to fit inside the largest bucket.

2.2.4.  Encryption

   After framing and padding the compressed payload, the entire
   plaintext message is encrypted using HPKE with the encapsulation
   performed according to [OHTTP].  Since we are repurposing the OHTTP
   encapsulation mechanism, we define the media type "message/auction
   request" which is used for encryption.

2.3.  Trusted Auction Server To Browser

   This section describes how the browser MUST interpret response
   messages from the Trusted Auction Server.

2.3.1.  Decryption

   The response message is encrypted using HPKE with the encapsulation
   performed according to [OHTTP] as the response to the request
   message.  Since we are repurposing the OHTTP encapsulation mechanism,
   we define the media type "message/auction response" which is used for
   encryption.  The browser SHALL decrypt the response by following the
   standard [OHTTP] Encapsulated Response decryption procedure
   (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9458#section-4.4-5).

2.3.2.  Decompression

   The message framing is as in Section 2.2.3, but the entire response
   payload is compressed.  The Server shall zero pad the response
   (TODO).

2.3.3.  Response Payload Data

   The response has the following data, serialized as [CBOR] and
   matching the following shape (described via [CDDL]):

   response = {
     ; The ad to render.
     adRenderURL: adRenderUrl,

     ; List of URLs for component ads displayed as part of this
     ; ad.
     ? components: [* adRenderUrl],

     ; Name of the InterestGroup to which the ad belongs.
     ? interestGroupName: tstr,

     ; Origin of the Buyer who owns the interest group.
     ? interestGroupOwner: origin,

     ; that submitted a bid.
     ? biddingGroups: {
       * origin => [* int]
     },

     ; Score of the ad determined during the auction.
     ; Any value that is zero or negative indicates that the ad cannot
     ; win the auction.

     ? kAnonWinnerJoinCandidates: [* KAnonJoinCandidate],

     ; Positional index of the k-anon winner.
     ; Note: Positional index >= 0.
     ; If this is equal to 0, the highest scored bid is also K-Anonymous
     ; and hence a winner.
     ; If this is greater than 0, the positional index implies the index
     ; of the first K-Anonymous scored bid in a sorted list in
     ; decreasing order of scored bids.
     ; In this case, the highest scored bid that is not K-Anonymous is
     ; the ghost winner.
     ; In case all scored bids fail the K-Anonymity constraint, this
     ; would be set to -1 since there is no winner.
