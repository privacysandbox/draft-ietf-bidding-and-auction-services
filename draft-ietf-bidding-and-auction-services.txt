1.  Introduction

   Today, real-time bidding and ad auctions are executed on servers that
   may not provide technical guarantees of security.  Some users have
   concerns about how their data is handled to generate relevant ads and
   in how that data is shared.  Protected Audience API (Android
   (https://developer.android.com/design-for-safety/privacy-sandbox/
   fledge), Chrome (https://developer.chrome.com/docs/privacy-sandbox/
   fledge/)) provides ways to preserve privacy and limit third-party
   data sharing by serving personalized ads based on previous mobile app
   or web engagement.

   This Bidding and Auction Services proposal outlines a way to allow
   Protected Audience computation to take place on cloud servers in a
   Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), rather than running locally on a
   user's device.  Running workloads in a TEE in cloud has the following
   benefits:

   *  Scalable ad auctions.

      -  A scalable ad auction may include several buyers and sellers
         and that can demand more compute resources and network
         bandwidth.

   *  Lower latency of ad auctions.

      -  Server to server communication on the cloud is faster than
         multiple device to server calls.

      -  Adtech code can execute faster on servers with higher computing
         power.

   *  Higher utility of ad auctions.

      -  Servers have better processing power, therefore adtechs can run
         compute intensive workloads on a server for better utility.

      -  Lower latency of ad auctions also positively impact utility.

   *  Security protection

      -  TEEs can protect confidentiality of adtech code and signals.

   *  System health of the user's device.

      -  Ensure better system health of user's device by freeing up
         computational cycles and network bandwidth.

   Standardized protocols for interacting with Bidding and Auction
   Services are essential to creating a diverse and healthy ecosystem
   for such services.

1.1.  Scope

   This document provides a specification for the request and response
   message format that a client can use to communicate with remote
   services that allows the client to offload much of the work involved
   in running an advertisement selection auction as part of the client's
   implementation of the Protected Audience API.

   This document does not describe distribution of private keys to the
   Bidding and Auction services.

1.2.  Terminology

   The key word "client" is to be interpreted as an implementation of
   this document that creates Requests (Section 2.2) and consumes
   Responses (Section 2.3).  The key phrase "Bidding and Auction
   Services" is to be interpreted as an implementation of this document
   that consumes Requests and creates Responses.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Message Format Specifications

2.1.  Overview

   To understand this document, it is important to know that the
   communication between the client and the remote services uses a
   request-response message exchange pattern.  The request will first
   reach a seller service, after which the seller will forward parts of
   the request to buyer service.  It is then up to the seller service to
   gather buyer responses and form a final response for the client.
   More detail about the seller and buyer services can be found in the
   server-side system design documentation
   (https://github.com/privacysandbox/protected-auction-services-
   docs/blob/main/bidding_auction_services_system_design.md).

2.1.1.  Common Definitions

   Section 2 makes frequent use of the following definitions.

                                 Table 1

2.1.2.  Message Framing and Padding

   Bidding and Auction Services requests and responses have the
   following framing:

   +==========+=========+=============+========+=============+=========+
   | Byte     | 0       | 0           | 1 to 4 | 5 to        | Size+5  |
   |          |         |             |        | Size+4      | to end  |
   +==========+=========+=============+========+=============+=========+
   | Bits     | 7-5     | 4-0         | *      | *           | *       |
   +----------+---------+-------------+--------+-------------+---------+
   | Contents | Version | Compression | Size   | Request     | Padding |
   |          |         |             |        | Payload     |         |
   +----------+---------+-------------+--------+-------------+---------+

                                  Table 2

   where the the first 3 bits of the frame header specify the payload
   version and the following 5 bits specify the compression algorithm.
   The format described in this document corresponds to version 0.

   The compression method's value in bits 4-0 in Section 2.2.2
   corresponds to the below table:

                    +=============+==================+
                    | Compression | Description      |
                    +=============+==================+
                    |      0      | No Compression   |
                    +-------------+------------------+
                    |      1      | Brotli [RFC7932] |
                    +-------------+------------------+
                    |      2      | GZIP [RFC1952]   |
                    +-------------+------------------+
                    |     3-31    | Reserved         |
                    +-------------+------------------+

                                 Table 3

   The amount of padding depends on the type of message and will be
   discussed for each message type separately.

   GZIP MUST be implemented by the Client and the Bidding and Auction
   Services, while Brotli MAY be.

2.2.  Request Format

   This section discusses the request message sent from the client to
   the Bidding and Auction Services endpoint.

   The request from the Client to Bidding and Auction Services consists
   of an [HPKE] encrypted payload with attached header (see
   Section 2.2.1).  The plaintext payload contains a framing header,
   outer request, and padding (see Section 2.2.2).  The request message
   Section 2.2.3 is a [CBOR] encoded message that contains one or more
   compressed interest group lists Section 2.2.3.1.

2.2.1.  Encryption

   The request is encrypted with [HPKE].  The request uses a similar
   encapsulated message format to that used by [OHTTP], with only an
   additional version field.

   Encapsulated Request {
     Version (8),
     Key Identifier (8),
     HPKE KEM ID (16),
     HPKE KDF ID (16),
     HPKE AEAD ID (16),
     Encapsulated KEM Shared Secret (8 * Nenc),
     HPKE-Protected Request (..),
   }

   The Version for this message SHOULD be 0.  The HPKE KEM ID, HPKE KDF
   ID, and HPKE AEAD ID are the key encapsulation mechanism, key
   derivation function and authenticated encryption with associated data
   function parameters for [HPKE].  For this protocol, a compliant
   implementation MUST support DHKEM(X25519, HKDF-SHA256) (0x0020) for
   HPKE KEM ID, HKDF-SHA256 (0x0001) for HPKE KDF ID, and AES-256-GCM
   (0x0002) for HPKE AEAD ID.

   Encryption of the request is similar to in [OHTTP] Section 4.3
   (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9458#name-encapsulation-of-
   requests), only with a different media type and the Version prepended
   to the encrypted message:

   1.  Construct a message header (hdr) by concatenating the values of
       the Key Identifier, HPKE KEM ID, HPKE KDF ID, and HPKE AEAD ID in
       network byte order.

   2.  Build a sequence of bytes (info) by concatenating the ASCII-
       encoded string "message/auction request", a zero byte, and hdr.

   3.  Create a sending HPKE context by invoking SetupBaseS()
       (Section 5.1.1 (https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9180#section-5.1.1)
       of [HPKE]) with the public key of the receiver pkR and info.
       This yields the context sctxt and an encapsulation key enc.

   4.  Encrypt request by invoking the Seal() method on sctxt
       (Section 5.2 (https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9180#section-5.2) of
       [HPKE]) with empty associated data aad, yielding ciphertext ct.

   5.  Concatenate the values of Version, hdr, enc, and ct.

   In pseudocode, this procedure is as follows:

   hdr = concat(encode(1, key_id),
                encode(2, kem_id),
                encode(2, kdf_id),
                encode(2, aead_id))
   info = concat(encode_str("message/auction request"),
                 encode(1, 0),
                 hdr)
   enc, sctxt = SetupBaseS(pkR, info)
   ct = sctxt.Seal("", request)
   enc_request = concat(encode(1, version), hdr, enc, ct)

   A Bidding and Auction Services endpoint decrypts this encapsulated
   message in a similar manner to [OHTTP] Section 4.3 (https://www.rfc-
   editor.org/rfc/rfc9458#name-encapsulation-of-requests), or more
   explicitly as follows:

   1.  Parse enc_request into version, key_id, kem_id, kdf_id, aead_id,
       enc, and ct.

   2.  If version is not 0, return an error.

   3.  Find the matching HPKE private key, skR, corresponding to key_id.
       If there is no matching key, return an error.

   4.  Build a sequence of bytes (info) by concatenating the ASCII-
       encoded string "message/auction request"; a zero byte; key_id as
       an 8-bit integer; plus kem_id, kdf_id, and aead_id as three
       16-bit integers.

   5.  Create a receiving HPKE context, rctxt, by invoking SetupBaseR()
       (Section 5.1.1 (https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9180#section-5.1.1)
       of [HPKE]) with skR, enc, and info.

   6.  Decrypt ct by invoking the Open() method on rctxt (Section 5.2
       (https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9180#section-5.2) of [HPKE]), with
       an empty associated data aad, yielding request and returning an
       error on failure.

   In pseudocode, this procedure is as follows:

  version, key_id, kem_id, kdf_id, aead_id, enc, ct = parse(enc_request)
  if version != 0 then return error
  info = concat(encode_str("message/auction request"),
                encode(1, 0),
                encode(1, key_id),
                encode(2, kem_id),
                encode(2, kdf_id),
                encode(2, aead_id))
  rctxt = SetupBaseR(enc, skR, info)
  request, error = rctxt.Open("", ct)

   Bidding and Auction Services retains the HPKE context, rctxt, so that
   it can encapsulate a response.

2.2.2.  Framing and Padding

   The plaintext message uses the framing described in Section 2.1.2.

   Messages MAY be zero padded so that the encrypted request is one of
   the following bin sizes: 0KiB, 5KiB, 10KiB, 20KiB, 30KiB, 40KiB,
   55KiB.  An implementation MAY need to remove some data from the
   payload to fit inside the largest bucket.

   A compatible implementation processing requests SHOULD NOT rely on a
   specific padding scheme for requests.

2.2.3.  Request Message

   The request message is a [CBOR] encoded message with the following
   [CDDL] schema:

   request = {
     ; Current version of the protocol.
     ; In this document, it must be 0.
     version: int,
     ; Used by the Bidding and Auction Services to
     ; keep track of a request (and corresponding response)
     ; over its lifetime.
     ; Must be a [UUID][Version 4].
     generationId: uuid,
     ; Represents the publisher initiating the request.
     publisher: origin,
     interestGroups: {
       ; Map of interest group owner to CBOR encoded list of interest
       ; groups compressed as described in § Generating a Request.
       * interestGroupOwner => bstr
     },
     ? enableDebugReporting: bool
   }

   The version field SHOULD be set to 0 for this version of the
   protocol.  The interestGroups field is a map from interest group
   owner to a compressed, [CBOR]-encoded list of interest groups for
   that owner.

2.2.3.1.  List of Interest Groups

   A list of interest group is encoded in [CBOR] with the following
   [CDDL] schema:

   interestGroups = [ * interestGroup ]
   interestGroup = {
     ; This interest group's name, see
     ; https://wicg.github.io/turtledove/#interest-group-name.
     name: tstr,

     ; Keys used to look up real-time bidding signals, see
     ; https://wicg.github.io/turtledove/#interest-group-trusted-bidding-signals-keys.
     ? biddingSignalsKeys: [* tstr],
     ; Data about the user that the bidder can use during bid calculation, see
     ; https://wicg.github.io/turtledove/#interest-group-user-bidding-signals.
     ? userBiddingSignals: json,
     ; Contains various ads that the interest group might show. See
     ; https://wicg.github.io/turtledove/#interest-group-ads.
     ? ads: [* adRenderId],

     ; Contains various ad components (or "products") that can be used to
     ; construct ads composed of multiple pieces — a top-level ad template
     ; "container" which includes some slots that can be filled in with
     ; specific "products". See
     ; https://wicg.github.io/turtledove/#interest-group-ad-components.
     ? components: [* adRenderId],
     ? browserSignals: {
       ; Number of times the group was joined in the last 30 days.
       ? joinCount: int,

       ; Number of times the group bid in an auction in the last 30
       ; days.
       ? bidCount: int,

       ; Tuple of time-ad pairs for a previous win for this interest
       ; group that occurred in the last 30 days.
       ; The time is specified in seconds before the containing
       ; auctionBlob was requested.
       ? prevWins: [* [int, adRenderId]],

       ; The most recent join time for this group expressed
       ; in milli seconds before the containing auctionBlob
       ; was requested. This field will be used by newer client
       ; versions. For older devices, the precison will be in seconds.
       ; If recencyMs is present, this value will be used to offer
       ; higher precision. If not, recency will be used. Only
       ; one of the recency or recencyMs is expected to present in
       ; the request.
       ? recencyMs: int
     }
   }

   Each list is separately compressed with the compression method
   indicated in the Section 2.1.2 header.

2.2.4.  Generating a Request

   This section describes how the client MAY form and serialize request
   messages in order to communicate with the Bidding and Auction
   services.

   This algorithm takes as input all of the relevant interest groups, a
   config consisting of the publisher, a map of from (origin, string)
   tuple to origin ig pagg coordinators, an optional desired total size,
   an optional boolean debugging report locked out defaults to false, an
   optional list of interest group owners to include each with an
   optional desired size, and the [HPKE] public key with its associated
   key ID.  It returns an encrypted request and a request context tuple.

   1.   Let included_groups be an empty map.

   2.   If desired total size is not specified, but the list of interest
        group owners includes at least one entry with a specified
        desired size:

        1.  Set desired total size to the sum of all specified desired
            size in the list of interest group owners.

   3.   Group the list of relevant interest groups by owner into a map
        of from interest group owner to a list of interest groups sorted
        by decreasing priority, interest group map.

   4.   If the list of interest group owners is specified, remove
        interest groups whose owner is not on the list.

   5.   Construct a request, request with request["publisher"] set to
        publisher, request["version"] set to 0, request["generationId"]
        set to a new [UUID] Version 4 (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/
        rfc9562.html#section-5.4), and request["enableDebugReporting"]
        set to debugging report locked out.

   6.   Set current_size to be the serialized size of the encrypted
        request created from request without padding.

   7.   Set remaining_allocated_size to 0.

   8.   Set remaining_unsized_owners to 0.

   9.   For each interest group owner, interest group list in interest
        group map:

        1.  If there is a desired size for interest group owner:

            1.  Increment remaining_allocated_size by desired size.

        2.  Otherwise

            1.  Increment remaining_unsized_owners by 1.

   10.  For each interest group owner, interest group list in interest
        group map where there is a desired size specified for interest
        group owner:

        1.  If the number of unsized_owners is not 0:

            1.  Set the allowed_interest_group_size to the desired size
                for this interest group owner.  This is a fixed size
                allocation.

        2.  Otherwise:

            1.  Let remaining_size be equal to the desired total size-
                current_size.

            2.  Set the allowed_interest_group_size to
                remaining_size*desired_size/remaining_allocated_size.
                This is a proportional allocation.

        3.  Set remaining_allocated_size = remaining_allocated_size-
            current_size.

        4.  [CBOR] encode the interest group list into serialized list.

        5.  [GZIP] the serialized list into compressed list.

        6.  If setting request["interestGroups"][interest group owner]
            to compressed list would make it's serialized size more than
            allowed_interest_group_size larger than the current size,
            then remove the lowest priority interest group and repeat
            from the previous step.

        7.  Set request["interestGroups"][interest group owner] to
            compressed list.

        8.  Set included_groups[interest group owner] to interest group
            list.

        9.  Set current_size to be the serialized size of the encrypted
            request created from request without padding.

   11.  For each interest group owner, interest group list in interest
        group map where there is not desired size specified for interest
        group owner:

        1.  Let remaining_size be equal to the desired total size-
            current_size.

        2.  Set the allowed_interest_group_size to
            remaining_size*/remaining_unsized_owners.  This is a equal
            size allocation.

        3.  Decrement remaining_unsized_owners by 1.

        4.  [CBOR] encode the interest group list into serialized list.

        5.  [GZIP] the serialized list into compressed list.

        6.  If adding the compressed list to request would make it more
            than allowed_interest_group_size larger than the current
            size, then remove the lowest priority interest group and
            repeat from the previous step.

        7.  Set request["interestGroups"][interest group owner] to
            compressed list.

        8.  Set included_groups[interest group owner] to interest group
            list.

        9.  Set current_size to be the serialized size of the encrypted
            request created from request without padding.

   12.  If there are no interest groups in the request, discard the
        request and return failure.

   13.  Prepend the framing header to request with Compression set to 2.

   14.  If desired total size is set then zero pad request to desired
        total size.  Otherwise zero pad request up to the smallest bin
        size in Section 2.2.2 larger than request.

   15.  Encrypt request using the public key and its key id as in
        Section 2.2.1 to get the encrypted message and hpke context.

   16.  Let the request context be the tuple (included_groups, hpke
        context, ig pagg coordinators).

   17.  Return the encrypted message and the request context.

2.2.5.  Parsing a Request

   This section describes how the Bidding and Auction Services MUST
   deserialize request messages from the client.

   The algorithm takes as input a serialized request message from the
   client (Section 2.2.4) and a list of HPKE private keys (along with
   their corresponding key IDs).

   The output is either an error sent back to the client, an empty
   message sent back to the client, or a request message the Bidding and
   Auction services can consume along with an HPKE context.

   1.   Let encrypted request be the request received from the client.

   2.   Let error_msg be an empty string.

   3.   De-encapsulate and decrypt encrypted request by using the input
        private key corresponding to key_id, as described in
        Section 2.2.1, to get the decrypted message and rctxt.

        1.  If decapsulation or decryption fails, return failure.

        2.  Else, save the decrypted output as framed request and save
            rctxt.

   4.   Remove and extract the first 5 bytes from framed request as the
        framing header (described in Section 2.1.2), removing them from
        framed request.

   5.   If the framing header's Version field is not 0, return failure.

   6.   If the framing header's Compression field is not supported,
        return failure.  Otherwise, save the Compression field value as
        compression type.

   7.   Let length be equal to the framing header's Size field.

   8.   If length is greater than the length of the remaining bytes in
        framed request, return failure.

   9.   Take the first length remaining bytes in framed response as
        decodable request, discarding the rest.

   10.  [CBOR] decode decodable request into the message represented in
        Section 2.2.3.  Let this be request.

   11.  If [CBOR] decoding fails, return failure.

   12.  Let processed request be an empty struct.

   13.  If request is not a map, return failure.

   14.  If request["version"] does not exist or is not 0, return
        failure.

   15.  If request["publisher"] does not exist or is not a string,
        return failure.

   16.  Set processed request["publisher"] to request["publisher"].

        return failure.

   18.  Set processed request["generationId"] to
        request["generationId"].

   19.  If request["enableDebugReporting] exists:

        1.  If request["enableDebugReporting"] is not a boolean, return
            failure.

        2.  Set processed request["enableDebugReporting"] to
            request["enableDebugReporting"].

   20.  If request["interestGroups] does not exist or is not a map,
        return failure.

   21.  Set processed request["interestGroups"] to an empty map.

   22.  For each key, value map entry of request["interestGroups"]:

        1.  If key is not a string, append an error message to
            error_msg.  Proceed to Section 2.2.5.1.

        2.  Set processed request["interestGroups"][key] to an empty
            list.

        3.  Decompress value according to compression type and set as
            buyer input cbor.  If decompression fails, return failure.

        4.  [CBOR] decode buyer input cbor into buyer input.  If
            decoding fails, return failure.

        5.  If buyer input is not an array, return failure.

        6.  For each interest group in buyer input:

            1.   If the interest groups is not a map, append an error
                 message to error_msg.  Proceed to Section 2.2.5.1.

            2.   Let ig be an empty struct similar to Section 2.2.3.1.

            3.   If interest group["name"] does not exist or is not a
                 string, return failure.

            4.   Set ig["name"] to interest group["name"].

            5.   If interest group["userBiddingSignals"] exists:

                 1.  If interest group["userBiddingSignals"] is not a
                     string, return failure.

                 2.  Set ig["userBiddingSignals"] to interest
                     group["userBiddingSignals"].

            6.   If interest group["biddingSignalsKeys"] exists:

                 1.  If interest group["biddingSignalsKeys"] is not an
                     array of strings, return failure.

                 2.  Set ig["biddingSignalsKeys"] to interest
                     group["biddingSignalsKeys"].

            7.   If interest group["ads"] exists:

                 1.  If interest group["ads"] is not an array of
                     strings, return failure.

                 2.  Set ig["ads"] to interest group["ads"].

            8.   If interest group["component"] exists:

                 1.  If interest group["component"] is not an array of
                     strings, return failure.

                 2.  Set ig["component"] to interest group["component"].

            9.   If interest group["browserSignals"] exists:

                 1.  If interest group["browserSignals"] is not a map,
                     return failure.

                 2.  Let igbs be an empty struct similar to
                     browserSignals as defined in Section 2.2.3.1.

                 3.  Let signals be interest group["browserSignals"].

                 4.  If signals["bidCount"] exists:

                     1.  If signals["bidCount"] is not a valid 64-bit
                         unsigned integer, return failure.

                     2.  Set igbs["bidCount"] to signals["bidCount"].

                 5.  If signals["joinCount"] exists:

                     1.  If signals["joinCount"] is not a valid 64-bit

                 ].

   23.  Return processed request and rctxt to the Bidding and Auction
        Services.

2.2.5.1.  Request Parse Error Handling

   If Section 2.2.5 returns with failure, the following algorithm
   describes how the Bidding and Auction Services MUST respond.

   The input to this algorithm is error_msg, which MAY be returned from
   the point of failure in Section 2.2.5.

   The output is a response to the client.

   1.  If the failure happens before or during decryption, respond with
       an empty message.

   2.  Otherwise abort processing the request.

   3.  Let error be a new map with key-value pairs: [("code", 400),
       ("error", error_msg)].

   4.  Let response be a new Section 2.3.3.

   5.  Set response["error"] to error.

   6.  Serialize and send response to the client per Section 2.3.

2.3.  Response Format

   This section discusses the request message sent from the Bidding and
   Auction Services endpoint to the client in reply to a request.

   The response from the Bidding and Auction Services endpoint consists
   of an [HPKE] encrypted payload with attached header (see
   Section 2.3.1).  The plaintext payload contains a framing header,
   response message, and padding (see Section 2.3.2).  The response
   message Section 2.3.3 is a compressed [CBOR] encoded message.

2.3.1.  Encryption

   The response uses a similar encapsulated response format to that used
   by [OHTTP].

   Encapsulated Response {
     Nonce (8 * max(Nn, Nk)),
     AEAD-Protected Response (..),
   }

   Encryption of the response is similar to in [OHTTP] Section 4.4
   (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9458.html#name-encapsulation-of-
   responses), only with a different media type, repeated below for
   clarity:

   1.  Export a secret (secret) from context, using the string "message/
       auction response" as the exporter_context parameter to
       context.Export; see Section 5.3 (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/
       rfc9180.html#name-secret-export) of [HPKE].  The length of this
       secret is max(Nn, Nk), where Nn and Nk are the length of the AEAD
       key and nonce that are associated with context.

   2.  Generate a random value of length max(Nn, Nk) bytes, called
       response_nonce.

   3.  Extract a pseudorandom key (prk) using the Extract function
       provided by the KDF algorithm associated with context.  The ikm
       input to this function is secret; the salt input is the
       concatenation of enc (from enc_request) and response_nonce.

   4.  Use the Expand function provided by the same KDF to create an
       AEAD key, key, of length Nk -- the length of the keys used by the
       AEAD associated with context.  Generating aead_key uses a label
       of "key".

   5.  Use the same Expand function to create a nonce, nonce, of length
       Nn -- the length of the nonce used by the AEAD.  Generating
       aead_nonce uses a label of "nonce".

   6.  Encrypt response, passing the AEAD function Seal the values of
       aead_key, aead_nonce, an empty aad, and a pt input of response.
       This yields ct.

   7.  Concatenate response_nonce and ct, yielding an Encapsulated
       Response, enc_response.  Note that response_nonce is of fixed
       length, so there is no ambiguity in parsing either response_nonce
       or ct.

   In pseudocode, this procedure is as follows:

   secret = context.Export("message/auction response", max(Nn, Nk))
   response_nonce = random(max(Nn, Nk))
   salt = concat(enc, response_nonce)
   prk = Extract(salt, secret)
   aead_key = Expand(prk, "key", Nk)
   aead_nonce = Expand(prk, "nonce", Nn)
   ct = Seal(aead_key, aead_nonce, "", response)
   enc_response = concat(response_nonce, ct)

   Clients decrypt an Encapsulated Response by reversing this process.
   That is, Clients first parse enc_response into response_nonce and ct.
   Then, they follow the same process to derive values for aead_key and
   aead_nonce, using their sending HPKE context, sctxt, as the HPKE
   context, context.

   The Client uses these values to decrypt ct using the AEAD function
   Open.  Decrypting might produce an error, as follows:

   response, error = Open(aead_key, aead_nonce, "", ct)

2.3.2.  Framing and Padding

   The plaintext message uses the framing described in Section 2.1.2.

   Messages MAY be exponentially padded so that the encrypted response
   is a power of 2 in length.

   A compatible implementation processing requests SHOULD NOT rely on a
   specific padding scheme for requests.

2.3.3.  Response Message

   The response message is a [CBOR] encoded message, compressed using
   the method indicated in {#request-framing}. The [CBOR] encoded
   message SHOULD be serialized into deterministically encoded [CBOR]
   (as defined in Section 4.2 (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/
   rfc8949.html#name-deterministically-encoded-c)) and follows the
   following [CDDL] schema:

   response = {

2.3.4.  Generating a Response

   This algorithm describes how conforming Bidding and Auction Services
   MAY generate a response to a request.

   The input is a payload corresponding to Section 2.3.3 and the HPKE
   receiver context saved in Section 2.2.5, rctxt.

   The output is a response to be sent to a Client.

   1.  Let cbor payload equal the deterministically encoded CBOR
       (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8949.html#name-
       deterministically-encoded-c) payload.  Return an empty response
       on CBOR encoding failure.

   2.  Let compressed payload equal the [GZIP] compressed cbor payload,
       returning an empty response on compression failure.

   3.  Create a framed payload, as described in Section 2.3.2:

       1.  Create a framing header.

       2.  Set the framing header Compression to 2.

       3.  Set the framing header Version to 0.

       4.  Set the framing header Size to the size of compressed
           payload.

       5.  Let framed payload equal the result of prepend the framing
           header to compressed payload.

       6.  Padding MAY be added to framing header, as described in
           Section 2.3.2.

       7.  Return an empty response on failure of any of the previous
           steps.

   4.  Let response equal the result of the encryption and encapsulation
       of framed payload with rctxt, as described in Section 2.3.1.
       Return an empty response on failure.

   5.  Return response.

2.3.5.  Parsing a Response

   This algorithm describes how a conforming Client MUST parse and
   validate a response from Bidding and Auction Services.  It takes as
   input the request context tuple returned from Section 2.2.4 in
   addition to the encrypted response.

   1.   Use request context's hpke context as the context for decryption
        and follow the decryption steps in Section 2.3.1 to decrypt
        encrypted response and obtain framed response and error.

   2.   If error is not null, return failure.

   3.   Remove and extract the first 5 bytes from framed response as the
        framing header (described in Section 2.1.2), removing them from
        framed response.

   4.   If the framing header's Version field is not 0, return failure.

   5.   Let length be equal to the framing header's Size field.

   6.   If length is greater than the length of the remaining bytes in
        framed response, return failure.

   7.   Take the first length remaining bytes in framed response as
        compressed response, discarding the rest.

   8.   Decompress the compressed response into serialized response
        using the method indicated by framing header's Compression
        field, returning failure if decompression fails.

   9.   [CBOR] decode the serialized response into response, returning
        failure if decompression fails.

   10.  If response is not a map, return failure.

   11.  If response["error"] exists, return failure.

   12.  If response["isChaff"] exists and is either not a boolean or is
        true, return failure.

   13.  Let processed response be a new structure analogous to server
        auction response (https://wicg.github.io/turtledove/#server-
        auction-response).

   14.  If response["adRenderURL"] does not exist, return failure.

   15.  Set processed response["ad render url"] to

   17.  If response["interestGroupName"] does not exist or is not a
        string, return failure.

   18.  Set processed response["interest group name"] to

        failure if there is an error.

   21.  If response["biddingGroups"] does not exist or is not a map,
        return failure.

   22.  For each key, value in response["biddingGroups"]:

        1.  Let owner be equal to key parsed as an [ORIGIN], returning
            failure if there is an error.

        2.  If request context's included_groups does not contain owner
            as a key, return failure.

        3.  If value is not a list, return failure.

        4.  For each element in value:

                owner as a key, continue the next iteration of this
                loop.

            3.  If value is not a list, return failure.

            4.  For each element in value:

                1.  If element is not a map, continue the next iteration
                    of this loop.

                2.  If element["index"] does not exist or is not an
                    integer or element["updateIfOlderThanMs"] does not
                    exist or is not an integer, continue the next
                    iteration of this loop.

                3.  If element["index"] is not an integer or
                    element["index"] < 0, continue the next iteration of
                    this loop.

                4.  If element["index"] is greater than or equal to the
                    length of included_groups[owner], continue the next
                    iteration of this loop.

                5.  Let name be the interest group name for
                    included_groups[owner][element].

                6.  Let interest group key be the tuple (owner, name).

                7.  Let update duration be
                    element["updateIfOlderThanMs"], parsed into a time

                            4.  Set private aggregation
                                contribution["value"] to
                                contribution["value"].

                            5.  If is component win is true:

                                1.  Let key be a new structure analogous
                                    to [server auction private
                                    aggregation contribution key]
                                    (https://wicg.github.io/

                                2.  Set key["reporting origin"] to
                                    reporting origin.

                                3.  Set key["coordinator"] to
                                    coordinator.

                                4.  Set key["event"] to event.

                                5.  If processed response["component win
                                    private aggregation contributions"]
                                    does not contain key, set processed
                                    response["component win private
                                    aggregation contributions"][key] to
                                    a new array.

                                6.  Append private aggregation
                                    contribution to processed
                                    response["component win private
                                    aggregation contributions"][key].

                            6.  Otherwise if event contribution["event"]
                                starts with "reserved.", append private
                                aggregation contribution to processed
                                response["server filtered private
                                aggregation contributions

                            7.  Otherwise, append private aggregation
                                contribution to processed
                                response["server filtered private
                                aggregation contributions non
                                reserved"][key].

   34.  Return processed response.

2.3.5.1.  Parsing reporting URLs

   To parse reporting URLs on a [CBOR] map reporting URLs with a schema
   like reportingUrls from Section 2.3.3:

   1.  Let processed reporting URLs be a new structure analogous to
       server auction reporting info (https://wicg.github.io/
       turtledove/#server-auction-reporting-info).

   2.  If reporting URLs["reportingURL"] exists and is a string:

   3.  Let reporting URL be reporting URLs["reportingURL"] parsed as a
       [URL], or null if there is an error.

   4.  If reporting URL is not null, set processed reporting
       URLs["reporting url"] to reporting URL.

   5.  If reporting URLs["interactionReportingURLs"] exists and is a
       map:

   6.  For each key, value in reporting
       URLs["interactionReportingURLs"]: 1.  If key is not a string,
       continue with the next iteration.  1.  Let reporting URL be value
       parsed as a [URL].  If there is an error, continue with the next
       iteration.  1.  Set processed reporting URLs["beacon urls"][key]
       to reporting URL.

   7.  Return processed reporting URLs.
